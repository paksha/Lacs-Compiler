# Lacs Compiler
## Description
- Compiler written in Scala for the [Lacs language](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241e/current/lacs.html)
- Implemented closures, type checking, nested functions and garbage collection efficiently
- Used the CYK parsing algorithm to parse an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into MIPS Assembly
- This was implemented in 2019 as part of [CS 241E](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241e/) at the University of Waterloo.
